PeerReviewSimulation
====================

Peer Review Simulation for the grading of the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

This is a simmple simpulation I developed for the grading of the Getting and Cleaning Data class project.

There was so much uncertianity about how to grade I tought is would make a good use case for simulation
to determine a simulation of the grading could help narrow down potential scores, based on interpration of 
the grading requirements.

Try it you are taking the Getting and Cleaning Data Class.
