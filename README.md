PeerReviewSimulation
====================

Peer Review Simulation for the grading of the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

This is a simple simulation I developed for the grading of the Getting and Cleaning Data class project.

There was so much uncertianity about how to grade I thought is would make a good use case for simulation
to determine a simulation of the grading could help narrow down potential scores, based on interpration of 
the grading requirements.

Inputs:

The analysis is driven through a parameter list the defines the potential solutions (range).  The peer.review.simulation uses
the parameter list, number of samples and simulations.

Output:

A visualization containing all the possible results, with a simulated mean score.

Try it you are taking the Getting and Cleaning Data Class.
